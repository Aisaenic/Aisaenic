### About Me
I'm a graduate of Northeastern University with a Bachelors of Science in Cybersecurity and a concentration in Cyber Operations.

In my free time, I enjoy running NU Security Club, Northeastern University's Cybersecurity interest group, and Northeastern's chapter of Women in CyberSeurity (WiCyS) as VP, bringing together the small security community here at Northeastern :)
