## Hello wanderer, Emily here!âœ¨
### About Me
I'm a 2nd-year (rising 3rd-year) undergraduate honors student working towards a BS in Cybersecurity at Northeastern University, slated to complete a concentration in Cyber Operations, and potentially working towards an MS in Cybersecurity.

In my free time, I enjoy running NU Security Club, Northeastern University's Cybersecurity interest group, and Northeastern's chapter of Women in CyberSeurity (WiCyS) as VP, bringing together the small security community here at Northeastern :)
